Title: Azure SPA with Public Form Submission to Dataverse via DevOps
1. üß≠ Objective
Build a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) hosted in Azure that allows public users to submit a form, with the data securely written to Microsoft Dataverse. The app must support CI/CD via Azure DevOps and apply context engineering to ensure maintainability, traceability, and AI-assisted development.
2. üß± Functional Requirements
Feature	Description
Public Form Access	Allow unauthenticated users to submit a form (e.g. feedback, contact, registration).
Secure Submission	Use backend services (Power Automate or Azure Function) to validate and write data to Dataverse.
Frontend	React-based SPA with pages: Home, Contact, Blog, Form. Responsive layout with sticky header and footer.
All pages must be created with the solution
All pages will have the same header and footer (including new pages)

Dataverse Integration	Form data is written to a custom Dataverse table.
DevOps Integration	Source code hosted in Azure DevOps. CI/CD pipeline for build and deployment.
Context Engineering	Use structured metadata, reusable flows, and documented schemas to support AI tooling.
3. üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
‚Ä¢	Frontend: React, HTML5, CSS3
