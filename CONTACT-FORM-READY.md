# 🎯 **CONTACT FORM SHOULD NOW WORK!**

## ✅ **What's Fixed:**

1. **✅ Missing Column**: You created `e365_message` in Dataverse table
2. **✅ Code Mapping**: Azure Function already maps `message` → `e365_message` 
3. **✅ Authentication**: Managed Identity configured
4. **✅ Environment**: Dataverse URL set correctly
5. **✅ Build**: Latest code compiled successfully

## 🧪 **TEST INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Method 1: Use Debug Tool (Recommended)**
1. **Open**: `contact-debug.html` in your browser
2. **API Endpoint**: Already set to `https://polite-smoke-056b0d100.2.azurestaticapps.net/api/contact`
3. **Submit**: Test contact form
4. **Expected Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS!** No more "unknown error"

### **Method 2: Direct Browser Test**
1. **Go to**: https://polite-smoke-056b0d100.2.azurestaticapps.net
2. **Fill out**: Contact form on your main site  
3. **Submit**: Should work without errors

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes:**

### **✅ SUCCESS Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Thank you! Your message has been received and saved. We will contact you soon.",
  "submissionId": "[some-id]",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-19T..."
}
```

### **🔍 If Still Getting Errors:**
- **Authentication/Permission**: May need final role assignment in Power Platform Admin Center
- **Column Names**: Verify all required columns exist in Dataverse table
- **Table Name**: Ensure using correct table name (`e365_contact` or similar)

## 🚀 **GO TEST NOW!**

**The contact form should work immediately** since you've created the missing `e365_message` column! 

The code was already correct - it was just missing the Dataverse table column.

**Next**: Test the form and let me know the results! 🎉
